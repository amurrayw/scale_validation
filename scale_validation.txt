Scale Validation:

Testing to see if a scale "validates" on data.

Unitarity (assoc. with one factor). Generally done using confirmatory
factor analysis. Could be improved/fixed using FOFC.

Question: Even if the variables associate with one factor, how do we
know that the factor in question is actually the one we want to
measure?
